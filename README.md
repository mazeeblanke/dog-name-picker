# dog-name-picker

This is a little Python script I wrote which helped my wife and I select our new dog's name.

We recently got a dog after not having one for many years, and couldn't settle on a name
immediately. So instead of just picking one, we thought it'd be fun to let *her* pick her
own name!

So we listed out our favorite few names, threw them into this code, and then had her run
the script and pick her own name randomly =)

Programming is supposed to be fun, silly, and stupid sometimes. I love it.
